                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            My design is based on what I think represents myself. This is seen through the logo that I've made, which is supposed to show who I am as a person; including minor details such as wearing rounded glasses and wearing a sweater. </p>
                        <p>
                            It is also somewhat similar to the aesthetic that I am usually in. I am a friendly person showing the wave in the logo as well. I went for a more simple design as well which makes it easier for the reader and it gets straight to the point which is to
                            show them my contact etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I went with a darker background as I like purple and used that colour as well as to show the contrast between the yellow words. I chose yellow words to show the pop in the card. It is also easier to read the words with the contrast and it's overall quite
                            user friendly. The texture of the background also gives a very classy feel and will look nice under the lighting. The dotted lines will be the part where people can pop it open like a flap. This gives the card a bookmark function
                            so that the receiver of my name card can use it when they are reading or just attach it to a document.
                        </p>

                        <p>This increases the chances that they will be reminded of me when they are considering starting a project. Therefore they may contact me through the contact information found at the back of the card.</p>
                        <p>Since I have other information online such as my portfolio on my website, I have included a QR Code that allows the viewer to easily scan to go to the website. Even if they are unable to scan the QR Code, there is a link to my
                            website. </p>
                        <p>This allows for the viewer to be easily directed to my website and view more of my works. Making it so that there is enough space to show to all my socials as well. I have chosen Vistol as my main header font as it gives off that
                            strong and sharp vibes with its sharp edges and evenly spaced characters. I used Thinoo and Southampton fonts for the information at the back.
                        </p>

                        <p>This is so as Thinno gives clarity to the words that would be readable to anyone, furthermore it is also wider for better viewing. Southampton on the other hand gives the back a more classy vibe which is to match the aesthetic
                            i'm going for. Thus through the cardâ€™s simplicity in design, this is to extend my name to more people, ensuring that it is reactive and embodies who I am and the vibe I want others to experience when forming their first impressions
                            of me.
                        </p>
